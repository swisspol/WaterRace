I don't know//	if I'll really be able to handle every bug report, but I'd be interested in//	hearing from anyone who finds it useful or has suggestions for improvements.//	Because of variations in video hardware, there's no guarantee that this stuff//	will necessarily work for you or for your users... but it works for me, and//	everyone i've given it to so far.  The author shall not be held liable for//	any possible damage, etc, that might result from use of this library... use//	it at your own risk.  It's public domain, after all.  =)//	//	If you release software that takes advantage of this lib, it'd be awfully//	kind of you to send me a copy of the finished product by way of thanks, but it's//	certainly not necessary.  Although I *am* a poor college student who would//	greatly appreciate such a gift.... ;)////////	Contents:////		Everything you need to do a color gamma fade.  Includes a high-level//		API with calls such as FadeToColor and FadeToBlack, and a low-level API//		for when you absolutely need that extra bit of control.  Data storage//		is maintained in handles to be easy on your heap and prevent fragmentation.////	Technical background:////		Fading the screen to a color is a cool special effect.  There are several//		ways to do it... 'clut'-fading is one well-known technique for doing this//		type of fade by altering a monitor's color lookup table.  There's one caveat,//		though: it doesn't work in thousands or millions of colors, since those are//		direct-rgb modes that don't use cluts.  Gamma fading is the other option,//		but although there was a public domain lib to do percentage gamma fades//		to black, there hasn't been a free library to do gamma fading to an//		arbitrary color... until now, that is.  :>//		//		Color gamma fading is accomplished by fading the three channels of a//		screen's gamma table in the ratio of the r-g-b values of the color.//		The speed of a color gamma fade is generally much better than a 'clut'//		fade, providing silky-smooth transitions on both 68K and PPC.////	High-level API////		The gamma state of the attached monitor(s) is maintained in an opaque//		data structure called a GammaRef by the library.  Before fading, the//		user must call StartFading to retrieve the initial gamma state, and//		then StopFading afterward to dispose of the allocated state.//		StopFading can optionally restore the unmodified initial state before//		disposing of the GammaRef.  This is highly recommended, in case the gamma//		fader lib has screwed up somehow -- only in extraordinary circumstances//		would you ever *not* want to do this.//		//		The high-level API consists of three functions: FadeToColor, FadeToGamma,//		and FadeToBlack, with corresponding single-monitor versions.  FadeToColor//		takes a color to fade to as an argument, and FadeToGamma accepts a GammaRef//		similarly.  You can specify the number of steps in the fade (more steps take//		longer) and the type of fade to perform -- either linear, quadratic, or//		inverse quadratic. A linear fade does a straight interpolated fade between//		the two states, while the quadratic fade starts slowly and "accelerates" as//		it nears the destination.  (This looks good for a fade to black.)  Inverse//		quadratic is the opposite of quadratic, starting quickly and slowing//		down as it nears the destination.////		Before calling StopFading, you generally would call FadeToGamma with the//		initial state returned by StartFading to fade back into normal, rather than//		abruptly switching into it.//		//	Low-level API//		//		The low-level API provides more control, and allows you to do other things//		during a fade rather than just sit there.  I'm not going to go into great//		detail here... the functions are mostly self-explanatory, and the source is//		provided.  Figure it out.//		//		Note that as far as I can figure, the low-level API (with the exception of//		the ones that return GammaRefs, of course) does not move memory and therefore//		might be safe to call from interrupt time!?  Don't quote me on that one,//		since I've never tested it, but the only Toolbox calls made by the two low-level//		fade calls are BlockMoveData, PBControl, Get/SetGDevice, and SetEntries.  So if//		you really NEED to do fades at interrupt time, and enjoy living on the edge,//		it might just work.  Personally, I wouldn't recommend it, but you know, some//		people are crazy like that.//	//	Compilation notes////		By default, ColorGamma will try to link to the ANSI memset function to avoid//		unnecessary code duplication.  If you're not linking with the ANSI libs in//		your project, change the flags at the beginning of the file and #define//		EXTERN_MEMSET false.  There are a few other compilation flags... check out//		the .c file to see all of them.  (they're right at the top.)////	Other notes////		Thanks to Matt Slot for his input on the high-level API, and the tipoff on//		how to do the color gamma fade in the first place.  Thanks also to DaveK,//		whyte and everyone else who beta-tested this lib on #macdev.//		#ifndef __COLORGAMMA__#define __COLORGAMMA__#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endif// --------------------------------------------------------------------//	¥	Typedefs and enums// --------------------------------------------------------------------typedef struct OpaqueGammaInfo	**GammaRef;// ----------// Fade typestypedef UInt16	FadeType;enum {	inverseFade				= (1<<0),		// invert fade flag (for nonlinear fades)	linearFade				= (1<<1),	quadraticFade			= (1<<2),	inverseQuadraticFade	= quadraticFade | inverseFade};// ----------// Error codesenum {	noMonitorsCanFade		= -19400,	invalidFadeType			= -19401,	monitorCantDoColorGamma	= -19402};// --------------------------------------------------------------------//	¥	Prototypes// --------------------------------------------------------------------	// availability -- checks to make sure the ColorGamma traps are available.
